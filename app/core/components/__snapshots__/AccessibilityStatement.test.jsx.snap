          Some of our internal systems have had more testing than others. Testing has been conducted by Home Office staff and by contracted agencies. Where they have been checked for compliance, it has been against WCAG 2.0 AA and more recently WCAG 2.1 AA. We also increasingly test for compatibility and usability with assistive technologies such as screen readers.
