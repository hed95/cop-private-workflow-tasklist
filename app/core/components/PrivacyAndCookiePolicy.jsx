              Cookies allow COP administrators to understand how the platform is
              used, in order to improve the service—for example identifying the
              time period when the service is used least so that updates to it
              can be pushed out at these times; or streamlining how pages are
              accessed based on how users click through the site.
            </p>

              essential to the use of the service and you cannot opt out of

              </li>
              <li>
                _pk_ref: used to store information to initially identify you

            </ul>
            <p className="govuk-body">The two types of session cookies are:</p>

            <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Why we need this data</h2>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              We use cookie information to enable you to log into the service
              that we provide and to link information you add into COP to your
              account.
            </p>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              We use the information you provide to help ensure that we can
              enforce access control and keep data secure.
            </p>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              We use information about your email and your name that we hold
              within the system when we send you a notification. We use the
              GOV.UK Notify service, to send you notifications from COP to your
              Home Office email address; this service is operated and assured by
              the Cabinet Office.
            </p>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              The legal basis for processing your personal data is for the
              performance of a public task and under contract. Privacy and
              Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) require either the
              subscriber’s or the user’s consent. In the case that the employer
              is the subscriber and the employee the user, consent from the
              employer is reasonable if the use of the service is necessary for
              the employee to fulfil their duties.
            </p>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              We use a service called Matomo to collect information about how
              you use the COP. We do this to help make sure that the site is
              meeting the needs of its users and help us to make improvements to
              the site and service that we provide.

            <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">What we do with your data</h2>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              The data we collect may be shared with supplier organisations,
              other government departments, agencies and public bodies, but only
              when there is an appropriate Border Force business need that will
              be facilitated by sharing this data. For example, we will share
              some information with Home Office Performance and Reporting
              Analytics Unit (PRAU) for MI Reporting.
            </p>
            <p className="govuk-body">We will not:</p>
            <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            </ul>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              We will share your data if we are required to do so by law—for
              example, by court order—or to prevent fraud or other crime.
            </p>
            <p className="govuk-body">
              Information captured via cookies within Matomo includes a unique
              visitor ID, information to initially identify a user when a
              website is visited, analytical information and session data
              temporarily stored for the visit.

            <p className="govuk-body">
              In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data
              for the time you are a member of Border Force and then for a
              maximum of 5 years after you leave the Force.

              We use GOV.UK Notify, a service provided by Cabinet Office to send
